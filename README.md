# Spotify

We will start building the Spotify clone from scratch, starting from setting up a React Native project using Expo and finishing with connecting the application with a GraphQL backend using AWS Amplify. We will walk through designing the UI layout of the app, structuring everything in components, and putting everything together. We will also implement navigation between screens, header bars, and tab bars for the Spotify menu. 

For the backend, we will be using AWS Amplify, which is an amazing combination of tools and services from AWS, that helps us build mobile and web applications faster. It offers pre-made authentication components and flows, database, API (REST and GraphQL), storage, and much more.
